    "Here, we demonstate a simple evaluation of the policy's performance for a few random seeds. This is meant to serve only as an example, and we encourage you to develop your own evaluation metrics.\n",
    "We intialize the robot using five different random seeds, and simulate its performance for 100 time-steps. We then sum the rewards experienced during its interaction with the environment and track this total reward for the five trials. Finally, we report the mean and standard error for the total reward. The standard error is the standard deviation of a sample set divided by the square root of the number of samples, and represents the uncertainty in the estimate of the mean value."
